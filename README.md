# Automatic-Plant-Watering-Machine
The Automatic Plant Watering Machine is an innovative and efficient solution designed to alleviate the challenges of maintaining optimal moisture levels for plants. This smart device integrates mechanical, electrical, and fluid systems to create a seamless and automated watering process.

This machine will be activated only if the plant pot is detected. Then, the machine will pump water at set intervals to water the plant.

This is a group project made by our team: Noorul Ghousiah; Hanis Izani; Alharbi Raghad Kamel.
